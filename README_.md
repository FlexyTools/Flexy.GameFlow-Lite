Production-proven architecture, refined in real projects since 2012  
Design your game as explicit, testable states — from Boot and Meta to Core gameplay


## When game state architecture starts working against you

As projects grow, game state logic becomes fragile and hard to reason about

- Dependencies spread across systems, even when using DI
- Adding new game states introduces hidden coupling and side effects
- Custom flow solutions break as requirements change
- Transition chains become complex and difficult to maintain
- Testing a single state requires running the entire game

Flexy.GameFlow addresses this by design:

- A single hierarchical state model for gameplay, meta, UI, and overlays
- Any state can be launched and tested instantly, in isolation e.g., you can enter Play Mode directly in a menu, popup, or gameplay state without running entire game from boot
- States and transitions are awaitable, with explicit input and output data between states
- Each state owns its lifecycle and cleanup
- The same architecture scales from prototype to production


## Is this for you?

Flexy.GameFlow is a good fit if:
- Your project grows beyond a simple prototype
- You have multiple game states such as menus, meta, gameplay, or overlays
- Your game states need separate scenes or non-trivial scene navigation
- You care about clean architecture, testability, and long-term maintainability
- Flexy.GameFlow is an architectural foundation and is intended to be adopted early in a project

This asset is likely not a good fit if:
- You want a visual-only solution without writing code
- Your game states and scenes are simple and unlikely to grow in complexity


## Why Flexy.GameFlow specifically?

- Designed by a developer who builds complete games, not just frameworks
- Used as a foundation in multiple shipped games and long-term production projects
- including large-scale projects under NDA
- Framework-agnostic by intent, with no forced UI system, scene structure, or networking stack
- Free Lite version to validate the architecture before committing


## Flexy Game.Flow vs Other Solutions

- **Classic FSMs** do not scale to full game state hierarchies with async transitions
- **Scene managers** couple logic to scenes and make state testing difficult
- **Custom solutions** tend to degrade over time and are hard to maintain

**Flexy.GameFlow** treats **game states as first-class**, with hierarchy, isolation, and deterministic async transitions


## Advanced Capabilities

- Hierarchical game state composition with nested and layered states
- Clear separation between state lifecycle, logic, and view
- Enter Play Mode from any scene with the correct state hierarchy from the first frame
- Game states can be developed and tested in isolation
- Scene loading and unloading driven by game states
- Support for multi-scene maps and non-trivial navigation


## Technical details

- Modern C# (C# 10)
- Designed to work with Domain Reload disabled


### Features

- Single `State` base class for all state types (gameplay, UI, substates)
- Extensible lifecycle via virtual Show/Hide and BackShow/ForwardHide methods
- Deterministic bootstrap that initializes the correct state hierarchy for any scene
- Early initialization allowing Play Mode entry from any scene or state before the first frame
- Explicit state cleanup via `Stage.CloseAndDestroy`
- Explicit input and output data passed between states
- Awaitable states and transitions with strongly defined results
- Cross-scene references without hard scene dependencies
- Game states can be instantiated and tested in isolation


### Core Architecture & Runtime

- Bootstrap prefab initializes the GameFlow runtime
- Central `ServiceGameFlow` API for controlling game states from code
- Explicit `GameStage` abstraction for major phases (Boot, Meta, Core)
- `FlowLibrary` for centralized registration and lookup of states
- Graph-based state model using `FlowGraph` and `FlowNode`
- Runtime tracking of active and current state nodes
- Explicit `TransitionOperation` for deterministic state transitions


### GameFlow Pro Features

- Extended control over Play Mode initialization
- Additional virtual Open/Close and Forward/Back lifecycle methods
- Support for substate layers (e.g. popup layer)
- Customizable UniTask-based transition logic
- Deterministic await points for logical and visual state changes
- Asynchronous preload of state views
- Split-screen support via separate `BigStage` instances
